# smart-phone-dataset-for-camera-motion-estimation
The Phone dataset contains more than 10,000 images for 6 sequences with synchronized gravity direction and ground truth motion parameters. The images were captured using an iphone 6s at the resolution of 1280x720@30Hz. The corresponding IMUs data were captured @100Hz with built-in sensor InvenSense MPU-6500. We synchronize the frames and IMUs data based on their timestamps. The motion parameters obtained from RealityCapture were used as the ground truth.
